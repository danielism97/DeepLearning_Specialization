# Deep Learning Specialization

## Why keep a lab book
- to make a solid record of what you have done
- to be able to fluently continue on previous work
- to enable other people to assess and replicate your work

## Important parts
- Name, signature, data, numbered pages
- reference notes through the pages
- reference main equations, put in the numbers

## Prepare for today's work
- plan ahead in lab book
- goals, description, list of methods

## Clarity of Goal: 
- What u personally wanna get out of ur work?
  - build knowledge of deep learning and neural networks
  - have experience building a learning system from scratch
  - replicate previous work on using DVS for steering direction prediction
  - seek for improvements

- What does EEE dept. want you to get out of all ur work?
  - learn what u r good doing - ur master skills
  - figure out what you don't know and would like to know
  - how to do **research**
  - how to **design**
  - how to manage **time**
  - how to work with a supervisor
  - how to identify client's **needs and problems**
  
## During a Session
- Keep commenting codes
- leave some space for spontaneous ideas
- record results
- always think: can I reproduce this?

## Design Cycle
- Need
  - what problem does the project solve?
- First Report
  - Needs brief
  - Literature review
  - Planning
    -expected outcomes
    -gannt chart
 
## What is literature review
- read abstract
- if useful, read introduction
- if useful, read conclusions
- if useful, read in detail
- improve what's there
- identify "cutting edge"
